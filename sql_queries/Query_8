Build a “send volume by country and kind” table: find the total volume of transfers (by
send_amount_scalar) sent in the past week, grouped by country and transfer kind



select sum(send_amount_scalar) as send_volume, wallets.ledger_location, transfers.kind
from transfers, wallets
where  (transfers.when_created = date_trunc ('week', current_timestamp - interval '1 week'))
group by kind, ledger_location
